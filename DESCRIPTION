Description: This package provides easy to use functions that can
    be used to perform initial exploratory data analysis. Instead of using
    multiple functions from multiple packages, this package allows a single 
    command to perform and display beneficial data information, allowing the 
    user to plan any necessary transformations and corrections prior to selecting
    the most appropriate model and or technique.
